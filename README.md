# Anthropic: Steering AI to Safety

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: Anthropic

* When was the company incorporated?: 2021

* **Who are the founders of the company?**
Anthropic was co-founded by siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei. 

* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**
Anthropic was created by Dario and Daniela out of a desire to create AI systems that could be more easily controlled or steered by humans. The siblings previously worked at OpenAI and were exposed to many of the potential risks of AI, while also becoming acutely aware of the benefits and potential. Anthropic is their attempt to develop AI that is "interpretable, steerable, and robustly safe."

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**
Anthropic is primarily funded via venture capital. It has received funding from many major players in the space, including Google, Amazon, Salesforce, and Zoom. Between Series A, B, and C funding, Anthropic has now raised over **$1 Billion** and is valued at over **$4 Billion**.

## Business Activities

* **What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
The goal of Anthropic is to develop AI systems that are transparent and easy to control, helping to address the ethical and safety concerns around AI. In his own words, Dario Amodei describes the reason he and Daniela left OpenAI and started Anthropic as:
> "you needed something in addition to just scaling the models up, which is alignment or safety. You don't tell the models what their values are just by pouring more compute into them. And so there were a set of people who believed in those two ideas. We really trusted each other and wanted to work together. And so we went off and started our own company with that idea in mind."

* **Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
Anthropic's primary customers are large businesses and organizations looking for advanced AI systems - especially chatbots - that prioritize safety and ethics. Current customers include companies such as Amazon, Quora, Slack, Zoom, Notion, and Juni Learning.

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**
Anthropic's primary strategic advantage is their laser-focus on ethics and what they call "AI Alignment" - that is, making sure that AI system's goals are aligned with human values and intentions. This approach is extremely appealing to large companies that fear a rogue chatbot turning off customers. Anthropic's Claude is the "helpful, honest, and harmless" AI system used for conversational and text-processing tasks (similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT).

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**
Anthropic's primary deliverable product is Claude (now Claude 2.1). As such, most of their technology involves working with Large Language Models (LLM's), large-scale machine-learning systems, language modeling with transformers, and reinforcement learning. 
On the careers tab of Anthropic's website, they frequently mention they are looking to hire engineers with Python experience as it relates to Machine Learning. They are implementing a wide-reaching tech-stack and a workforce with extremely diverse expertise to help mitigate the potential risks of AI. In fact, Anthropic is specifically hiring multiple roles with the sole-purpose of working with external experts to mitigate potential cybersecurity, biosecurity, and other potential risks. 


## Landscape

* **What field is the company in?**
Anthropic is broadly in the AI field... more specifically they focus on AI safety and ethics, by presenting their own home-grown competition to the existing products on the market (ChatGPT, LLaMA.)

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5-10 years?**
The major innovation in this field took place in 2017 with the introduction of the Transformer - a new neural network architecture based on a self-attention mechanism. The introduction of the Transformer in tandem with other advances in AI led to massive leaps in natural language processing and machine learning efficiency. The primary trend in the last year has been a push towards safety in AI and keeping it in line with human values. Anthropic is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this trend. 

* **What are the other major companies in this field?**
Google, OpenAI, and Meta are the main competitors in the field, each presenting their own GPTs - Bard, GPT-4, and LLaMA2.

## Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
Anthropic has made a huge splash in the AI space. With backing from major companies (including some "competitors"), Anthropic has proven that their AI assistant (Claude 2.1) is addressing the concerns in AI safety and responsbility. With a multi-billion dollar valuation, seemingly endless funding, and multiple big-name clients, Anthropic is leading the AI space in safety and ethics. 

* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?**
The core metric of any business is profitability. Anthropic is on pace to generate over **$100,000,000** this year, and continues to grow at a rapid pace. Despite falling behind competitors in this metric (OpenAI is projecting over **$1 billion** in revenue over the next 12 months), Anthropic appears to be very successful and continues to grow in this metric. 
Another metric used to measure "success" are standardized test and benchmarks for AI models. Anthropic's Claude 2 scored *78.5%* on the MMLU, which is a better performance than GPT3 & GPT3.5, but it still lags behind the leader in the space - OpenAI's GPT-4 (*86.4%*).

* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?**
Anthropic is one of the most competitive companies in the AI field. With partnerships such as Google Cloud, Boston Consulting Group, and Zoom, Anthropic is no longer an underdop in the space. Although not leading the space, Anthropic's approach to AI safety and ethics has been proven to be an effective business strategy, while also meeting the needs of companies and individuals. Anthropic's strategy to work primarily with large companies who value safety and ethics and not market their Claude AI Assistant as much for individual use has taken them in a different direction from OpenAI. The AI arms race is just beginning, and despite OpenAI's early lead, it remains to be seen which company(s) will emerge on top. 

## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**
If I were to advise Anthropic, I would suggest they begin targeting large educational institutions and find ways to integrate Claude into broad educational systems. 

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
Forming partnerships with public and private education institutions could open a whole new market to AI, and if Anthropic can lead the charge and monopolize the space, it would be a huge advantage in terms of both adoption and finances. Claude would be the natural choice for educational institutions looking to implement AI in the educational experience due to its heavy focus on safety, ethics, and unbiased responses.

* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
This would continue using their AI Assistant Claude, but would slightly customize it to focus on educational uses. Things such as creating personalized education and training plans for students and professionals. 

* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
Businesses and individuals are rapidly adopting AI, but the educational system is lagging behind. Students and teachers/professors may be adopting the technology on an indivudal level, but it's potential for use in a systemic way is being vastly underutilized. By brdiging this gap, Anthropic could enter a "blue sea" market and provide a huge benefit to educational systems and the individuals within, while increasing their total market share significantly. Their existing product (Claude 2.1) is the perfect solution for educational use-cases. From personalized learning assistants to automated grading and assignment feedback to tutoring and mentoring programs, Claude is the perfect tool to meet the needs of the education system while promising safety and security that other AI tools may be lacking.
